 he aim of our project is to obtain information on the status of the crops in real-time by using IoT devices to collect data from sensors.You can gain knowledge to improve your harvesting decisions by using predictive analytics.The trend analysis aids farmers in forecasting impending weather and crop harvesting.
 in this case we will have rational farm management plans to save both time and money.
 
 ## Technologies
